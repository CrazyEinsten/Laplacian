# Laplacian
Its the third Digital Image processing<br/>
Its not very hard, but I got a wrong when I was coding.<br/>
T forgot to transfer the dict to numpy array, and the python gave me a error: "TypeError: 'int' object is not subscriptable"<br/>
Emmmmmmmmmmmm, yup, Im sure I will remember it at the next time........<br/>
